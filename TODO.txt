Prerequisites
================

Entrance/Exiting: A user will be able to enter this nether world once every 12-24 hours, please use a constant again in the main or a help
 class, to define this time length. The user should also have the permission node "Deity.nether.general", for entrance permission, and if 
 they have "Deity.nether.override", they can join any time they so desire. Once they are in this world they have 1 hour to do what they 
 need to do, please use another constant for this time length. When their hour is up they will get removed from this world and brought 
 back to the main world. If you die before you hour is up in the nether you lose the remaining time and get ported back to the main world. 
 We would like you to use a MySQL database for the users time in the world. Enter a row for the user when they join the world, and store 
 the name of the user and the time of entrance. Then when the user exits store how long they were in the nether in another column so you 
 can verify time constraints later on . Please also link the entrance/exit to commands, you can use the /nether command with any sort of 
 arguments you so desire.

Spawn: The spawn location of the world should always be at x:0, z:0, however the height should not be located in any blocks. We probably
will require pasting a schematic at the spawn location, however dont worry about that, just put a //TODO where that should be located,
so we know where to put the code for it. 

Inventory: When entering the nether you are allowed to bring any sort of tools/swords/armour/food if any other items are present in their
inventory the users will be notified of this and the access denied, until they remove those items from their inventory. As for 
restrictions on bringing items back, there is none.

Mobs: Mobs need not be altered with one exception. Pigman should have a 10% chance of dropping gold, please also make this 10% a constant
that we can change later.
