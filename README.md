DeityNether
===========

Nether plugin for ImDeity: Kingdoms

Config values are used througout the plugin. This is so I can test different features of the plugin. Plus, I don't like hardcoding things, so config values help me on that part.

Enter the nether - /nether join
Leave the nether - /nether leave

An ennum is used that stores all values of items that can be brought into the nether. This enum can be found at src/com/imdeity/deitynether/util/AllowedItems.java

Each item is organized into three groups: Food, Armour, and Tools. This is purely cosmetic and has no effect on the plugin whatsoever.
